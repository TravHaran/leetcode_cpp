Matrix Addition

Add the two  matrices given below and find the integers corresponding to a, b, c , d, e, f, g, h and i:

[1  2  3]       [4  5  6]     [a b c]
[2  3  4]   +   [7  8  9]  =  [d e f] 
[1  1  1]       [4  5  7]     [g h i]
To submit your answer, enter the resultant values of each of the nine integers (i.e. a, b, c , d, e, f, g, h and i) on a new line and click Submit Code.
